/*
There are two types of Traversals:
1. Breadth First Traversal
2. Depth First Traversal
These refer to general directions
BFS goes from Left to Right

BFS::::::
          N1
    N2          N3
N4      N5   N6     N7   
Go from Left to right
Start with Root - N1
Then from N2 to N3
Then from N4 to N7
------->

DFS::::::
It goes from Top to Bottom
And it have 3 types:
-> Inorder
-> PreOrder
-> PostOrder


Whats Left?
-> Which one is better DFS or BFS?
-> Out of Inorder, Preorder and Postorder which one is better?
