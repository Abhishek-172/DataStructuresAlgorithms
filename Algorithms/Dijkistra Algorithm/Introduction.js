/*
Dijkistra Algorithm is also known as a Shortest Path Algorithm
It uses Priority Queue as its implementation.

Objectives:
    -> Understand the importance of Dijkistra Algorithm.
    -> Implement a Weighted Graph. So far in Graphs we are only working with a Unweighted Graph
    -> Walk through the steps of Dijkistra's
    -> Implement this algoritm using a naive priority queue.
    -> Also implement this algo using a Binary Heap Priority Queue.

What is it?
    -> One of the most famous and widely used algorithms around!
    -> It finds the shortest path between vertices on a graph
    -> What's the fastest way to get from Point A to point B?

Who was Dijkistra?
    -> He was a Dutch Programmer, physicist, essayist, and all around smarty pants.
    -> He helped to advance the field of computer science from an "art" to an academic discipline.'
    -> Many of his discoveries and algorithms are still commonly used to this day.

    Uses:
    -> GPS, Airline Ticket (Finding a Cheapest Ticket from D1 to D2)
