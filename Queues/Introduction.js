/*
Queue follows FIFO i.e. First in First Out
Queue exists everywhere, where do we use them in programming....
-> Background Tasks
-> Uploading Resources
-> Printing / Task Processing -> It prints one page at a time.
How we can Build a Queue?
-> via Array
We just need the combintions
unshift and pop
shift and push

But Both the combinations wont work with the large data set
Why?
The same reason, each element will be reindexed which is not so efficient

-> via class/Singly Linked List
Add to the end, at tail
Remove from the start, at head

To add in a Queue we call it a N-Queue
To delete from a Queue we call it a D-Queue
